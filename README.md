# Fist-game
Here some bad code for you.
This is a home-made game consisted of a 4x4 layout where you have to create words with 16 letters changing randomnly and turning up in the lay out. The aim of the game is to make as much poins as you can without the timer reaching 0.

It's the first time I use Allegro 5, so I'm pretty sure my code is easily improvable. Do not pull please, just clone the project and edit it. If you know some ways to optimice the programme or anything, please let me know. 
Thank you.
